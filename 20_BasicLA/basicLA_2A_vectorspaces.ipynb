    "## Real Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, we often want to view vectors as a one-dimensional data array (like a list of numbers) that represents a point in a higher-dimensional analogue of the two-dimensional Euclidean plane. \n",
    "To be able to manipulate vectors, it is important to understand that such a vector is an element of a vector space, where a vector space is an abstract thing whose elements satisfy certain mathematical rules.\n",
    "These rules are essentially vector addition and scalar multiplication. \n",
    "Anything that satisfies these rules is a vector. \n",
    "Here we limit out discussion to real vector spaces, meaning vector spaces involving real numbers, since in data science we typically deal with real vectors and real scalars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a definition for real vector spaces. \n",
    "A vector space is a set $\\mathbf{V}$ equipped with two operations:\n",
    "* (i) Addition: adding any pair of vectors $\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbf{V}$ yields another vector $\\mathbf{z}=\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}$ that is also in the same vector space, i.e., $\\mathbf{z}=\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbf{V}$\n",
    "* (ii) Scalar Multiplication: multiplying a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbf{V}$ by a scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ yields another vector $\\mathbf{z}=c \\mathbf{v}$ that is also in the same vector space, i.e., $\\mathbf{z} = c \\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbf{V}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  operations  of  adding  two  vectors  and  multiplying  a  vector  by  a  scalar  are  simple,  but  they  are very powerful.  \n",
    "Indeed, these two operations form the foundation for all of linear algebra.  \n",
    "One reason the two operations of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a scalar are so powerful is that the output of each of these two operations is itself a vector, upon which these operations can be performed again. \n",
    "Further, these two operations obey the following axioms, that are valid for all $\\bf u, v,w \\in \\bf V$ and all scalars $c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Commutativity of addition: $\\bf v + w = w + v$.\n",
    "* Associativity of addition: $\\bf u + (v+w) = (u+v) + w$.\n",
    "* Additive identity: There is a element $\\bf 0 \\in V$ that satisfy $\\bf v + 0 = v$ and $\\bf 0+v=v$.\n",
    "* Additive inverse: For each $\\bf v \\in V$ there is an element $\\bf -v \\in V$ such that $\\bf v+(-v) = 0$ and $-v+v = 0$.\n",
    "* Distributivity of scalar multiplication: $(c+d) \\mathbf{v} = (c\\mathbf{v} ) + (d\\mathbf{v})$, and $c (\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w)} = (c\\mathbf{v} ) + (c\\mathbf{w})$.\n",
    "* Associativity of scalar multiplication: $c(d\\mathbf{v}) = (cd)\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "* Unit for scalar multiplication: the scalar $1\\in \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $1\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the two operations and the axioms, it is best to start by looking at vectors in $2$ dimensions. \n",
    "In the following, we will use the two vectors $\\bf v$ and $\\bf w$ that are vectors in $\\bf v,w \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$."
