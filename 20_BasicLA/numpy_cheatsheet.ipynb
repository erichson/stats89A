    "Why do we need NumPy for data science? \n",
    "First, data typically arise in form of tables (and in many cases those tables consist of numbers on which we want to perform numerical operations). \n",
    "Second, vectorized operations are fast and powerful and speed and resources are very important in data science. \n",
    "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a Python library that is specialized on working with numerical arrays. \n",
    "Since, as a practical matter, linear algebra often amounts to working with numerical arrays (on which we can the perform operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition), NumPy is often the best way to do it in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations on NumPy arrays can be up to 50 times faster than traditional Python lists. \n",
    "Also, NumPy provides a large number of functions for matrix computations, and NumPy is the foundation of the Python machine learning stack. \n",
    "All in all, it is well worth becoming very familiar with it.\n",
    "In the following, we will give a brief introduction to NumPy and introduce some important function that we will use in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any library in Python, we first need to import NumPy. \n",
    "If you use Anaconda, then NumPy is included, otherwise you need to install NumPy by hand. \n",
    "Fortunately, that is as easy as issuing the following command."
