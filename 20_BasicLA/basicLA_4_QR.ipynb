    "# Gram--Schmidt and the QR Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous workbook, we saw the definition of an _orthogonal set_ of vectors. Indeed, the set $V = \\{v_1,\\dots, v_k\\}$ is an _orthogonal set_ if $v_i^\\top v_j = 0$ for all $i\\neq j$. The set $V$ is _orthonormal_ if in addition to being orthogonal, we have that $\\|v_i\\| = 1$ for all $i=1,\\dots,k$. Of course, if we have an orthogonal set it is easy to construct an orthonormal set by simply dividing each vector by its norm. Therefore, the hard work lies in finding orthogonal sets.\n",

Can we find a set of orthonormal vectors $v_1,\\dots, v_k$ such that $\\text{span}(a_1,\\dots, a_k) = \\text{span}(v_1,\\dots, v_k)$? It turns out that we can use an algorithm called the _Gram--Schmidt procedure_ (or _Gram--Schmidt process_) to accomplish this. \n",

Moreover, we can see that $u_1,\\dots,u_k$ must have the same span as $a_1,\\dots, a_k$, since $u_j$ can be written as a linear combination of $a_1,\\dots, a_j$ for any $j$. \n",
