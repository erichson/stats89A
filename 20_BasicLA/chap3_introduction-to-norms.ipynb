    "# Introduction to Norms \n",
    "\n",
    "A _norm_ is a function that measures the \"size\" of something. \n",
    "One example of a norm is the familiar Euclidean norm, which uses the expression $(x_1^2+x_2^2)^{1/2}$ to compute the \"size\" or \"magnitude\" of a point $(x_1,x_2)$ in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane.\n",
    "If we view that point as a vector, then that is the Euclidean norm of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's start with vectors and norms of vectors.\n",
    "(We can have norms for other things, like matrices, functions, etc., but let's start with vectors and norms of vectors.)\n",
    "In linear algebra, _vectors_ are objects that are used to model data that we will work with frequently; and it is common to consider the norm of a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean norm, and its generalization to vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, is particulalry important for linear algebra and data science.\n",
    "However, there are other norms, and many of these other norms are also useful.\n",
    "So, it is important to be familiar with them and their basic properties.\n",
    "Here, we will introduce and work with different types of norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk more later about exactly what vectors are mathematically, but for now and for the sake of computation it is common to think of a vector simply as a array of numbers upon which certain operations can be performed. \n",
    "In Python, the most convenient way to store a vector is in a numpy array, such as the following:"

    "\n",
    "When applied to vectors, a _norm_ function that takes as input a vector and that returns a single non-negative number. \n",
    "The most common norm is the so-called _Euclidean norm_.\n",
    "For for a general $n$-dimensional vector $x = (x_1,\\dots,x_n)$, the Euclidean is given by\n",

    "This formula may seem unfamiliar now, but it is the \"obvious\" extension of the familiar Euclidean norm to vectors with $n$ components.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n=2$, then this is simply the $2$-dimensional example in the plane:\n",
    "for a point $(x_1,x_2)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the (Euclidean) length of this vector is just \n",

    "\n",
    "This can also be seen as a special case of the Pythagorean Theorem: given a right triangle with side lengths $x_1$ and $x_2$, the length of the hypotenuse is given by $\\|x\\|_2$.\n",

    "Here, too, there is a similar interpretation in terms of the Pythagorean Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n \\ge 4$, then clearly we can sum up the squares of more than three numbers.\n",
    "The point of writing the Euclidean norm in this suggestive way is not just that the same expression holds for any $n$, even if $n \\ge 4$, when it is less easy to visualize these quantities, but also that this expression still gives a norm in those cases.\n",
    "Also, less obvious but still true, many of the interpretations in terms of angles, perpendicularity, etc., also hold true.\n",

    "    (This is sometimes called being _absolutely homogeneous_ or _absolutely scalable_.)\n",

    "- For vectors $x=(x_1,\\dots,x_n), y=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)$, when we write $x+y$ we mean the new vector $(x_1+y_1,\\dots, x_n+y_n)$.\n",
