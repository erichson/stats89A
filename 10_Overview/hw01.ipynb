    "In this assignment, we will practice using python to perform basic set operations. Problem 1 asks you to use python's set objects (covered in Section 2.1 of the workbook); problems 2, 3 and 4 ask you to use inner and outer join operations on a dataframe (covered in Section 2.2 of the workbook). We will use sets we construct as well as the ```students``` dataframe introduced in Section 2.2.\n",
