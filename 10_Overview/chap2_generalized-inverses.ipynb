    "# Generalized inverses \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen examples of left inverses for injective functions and right inverses for surjective functions. \n",
    "These left/right inverses are not inverses in full sense of the word, but they are functions that have the effect of \"undoing\" the action of a function (for left inverses) or doing something that the function \"undoes\" (for right inverses).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen that left/right inverses have an interesting property when they are applied on the \"other side,\" i.e., on the right/left, respectively: they are idempotent.\n",
    "Thus, they act as an identity when restricted to the image (of the function or right inverse, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function $f:A\\to B$ is neither injective nor surjective, then neither a left nor a right inverse exists.\n",
    "However, we can still have a type of inverse called a _generalized inverse_.\n",
    "A generalized inverse of a function $f:A\\to B$ is a function $g:B\\to A$ such that $g \\circ f \\circ g = g$ and $f\\circ g\\circ f = f$.\n",
    "- The property $g \\circ f \\circ g = g$ is a generalization of the left inverse condition that $g \\circ f = I_A$.\n",
    "- The property $f\\circ g\\circ f = f$ is a generalization of the right inverse condition that $f \\circ g = I_B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, generalized inverses are easier to work with than left/right inverses.\n",
    "- Any left inverse of a function $f$ satisfies both generalized inverse conditions.\n",
    "- Any right inverse of a function $f$ satisfies both generalized inverse conditions.\n",
    "- If a function $f$ and a generalized inverse $g$ of that function are _not_ restricted to their images, then their product (in either order, i.e., both $f \\circ g$ and $g \\circ f$) is idempotent. \n",
    "- If a function $f$ and a generalized inverse $g$ of that function are restricted to their images, then their product (in either order, i.e., both $f \\circ g$ and $g \\circ f$) is an Identity.\n",

    "Generalized inverses can be illustrated using the table operations we've seen before.\n",
    "However, these examples tend to get messy when dealing with domains and ranges. \n",
    "(The problem is not conceptual.  It's just that dataframes were not designed to do this.)\n",
