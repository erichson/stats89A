    "An _injective_ function is a mapping from a set $A$ to a set $B$ such that: if $a'\\neq a$ then $f(a)\\neq f(a')$. \n",
    "That is, $f$ is injective if and only if it maps distinct elements of the domain $A$ to distinct elements of the co-domain $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, if $f : A \\rightarrow B$ is injective, then this means that $A$ must be ``smaller'' (not larger than) than $B$, since if $A$ were larger than $B$, then at least two elements of $A$ would have to map to the same element of $B$.\n",
    "This intuition of larger/smaller is formally true for discrete sets and functions on discrete sets.\n",
    "Although it is not precisely true for infinite sets (such as the set of integers or the set of real numbers or the set of points on the Euclidean plane), it is not a bad intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will investigate injective functions.\n",
    "We will use the table operations we've seen before, as well as simple numerical examples.\n",
    "In both cases, we will see that injective functions always have special complementary functions called _left inverses_.\n",
