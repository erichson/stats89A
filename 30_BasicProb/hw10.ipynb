    "## Problem 1: concentration of angles in high dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the workbook, we saw that for a random vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ sampled uniformly at random from the unit ball $B_2 = \\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d : \\|x\\|_2 \\leq 1\\}$, the distance from $x$ to the origin begins to _concentrate_ around 1 as $d$ grows. That is, the \"mass\" of the unit ball concentrates at the edge of the ball. We also saw that the _pairwise distance_ between two points $x_i$ and $x_j$ concentrates as $d$ gets large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will see that a similar concentration phenomenon happens between angles in high dimensions. Since we will again be working with samples from the unit ball in this problem, we include the following function to sample uniformly from $B_2$."
